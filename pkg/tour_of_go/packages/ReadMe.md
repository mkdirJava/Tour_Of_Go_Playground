Golang Packages

Only these types are exported and only if the letter they begin with is capitalised

* Variable 
* Method
* Struct
* Interface
* Type

If you comment in the 

  package_use/package_use_test.go

Then it will not compile as the method it is trying to test does not begin with a capital letter
